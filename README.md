# Alegria
## 2007
### HTML, JS, PHP, Photoshop

This is one of my first published websites. It was made in 2007 on a customer's request. It was designed in Photoshop and exported using slicing technique to html. Php was only used to include header.php and footer.php. The project was presented to customer in a variety of colours.
